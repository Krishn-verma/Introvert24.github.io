        <h1>Creating a Custom Laptop Under 20,000 Rupees</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my blog where I share my idea of creating a custom laptop under 20,000 rupees. In today's digital age,
            having a reliable and affordable laptop is essential for various tasks such as work, education, and entertainment.
            However, finding a budget-friendly laptop with the desired specifications can be challenging. That's why I decided
            to explore the option of building a custom laptop within a limited budget.</p>

        <h2>Choosing the Right Components</h2>
        <p>The key to building a custom laptop on a budget is to carefully select each component based on performance, compatibility,
            and price. Here are some of the components I considered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Processor: Opt for a mid-range processor that offers a balance between performance and cost.</li>
            <li>RAM: Choose sufficient RAM for multitasking without overspending.</li>
            <li>Storage: Opt for a combination of SSD and HDD to balance speed and storage capacity.</li>
            <li>Display: Select a budget-friendly display with decent resolution and color accuracy.</li>
            <li>Battery: Prioritize a long-lasting battery for on-the-go productivity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building the Laptop</h2>
        <p>Once the components are selected, assembling the laptop requires careful attention to detail and following proper
            installation procedures. I documented my assembly process and troubleshooting steps to ensure a smooth build
            without exceeding the budget.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Creating a custom laptop under 20,000 rupees is a rewarding experience that allows you to tailor the specifications
            to your specific needs while staying within budget constraints. Through this blog, I aim to share my knowledge
            and inspire others to explore the possibilities of custom-built laptops.</p>
